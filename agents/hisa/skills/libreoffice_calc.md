# Skill: LibreOffice Calc

- Always use GUI operations for pivot tables.
- If no new sheet name is required, use `Sheet2` as the new sheet name.
- If the task requires creating a new column, name the new header exactly as required by the task.
- LibreOffice Calc does not support Excel-style sparklines; use regular charts or conditional formatting instead.
- If a field is an ID, code, ZIP/postal code, phone number, account number, SKU, or anything that must keep leading zeros, treat it as text.
- For these fields, do not use `pandas.to_excel()` as the default write-back path.
- Prefer `openpyxl` for `.xlsx` files and write the existing target cells directly.
- If the task requires modifying a column, update the entire target column, not just the rows currently visible in the screenshot; prefer code-based bulk edits so the whole column is changed reliably.
- Reuse the exact existing header text and casing. Do not create near-duplicate columns such as `Id` vs `ID`.
- Minimal save example: `cell.value = text_value; cell.number_format = '@'; wb.save(path)`.
- Verify by reading the same destination cells back and checking that the original target column was updated in place and the saved values still preserve the required text form, including any leading zeros.
- For spreadsheet fill/copy tasks, verify that the destination range actually changed instead of assuming a copy or paste action worked.
- If copy-paste, fill handle, or fill-down keeps failing on the same range, mark the subgoal `replan` or `stuck` and switch to a different method, including bash/Python when appropriate.
- For tasks affecting many rows or cells, keep track of the full target range and do not stop after updating only the first visible cell.
